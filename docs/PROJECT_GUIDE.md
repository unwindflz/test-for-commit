## Introduction

The **test-for-commit** project is a utility application designed to modify commit dates in Git repositories based on configuration settings. We welcome contributions from anyone interested in improving the project!

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment**  
   It is recommended to use a virtual environment for Python projects. You can create one using:
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   ```
   Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     .venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS and Linux:
     ```bash
     source .venv/bin/activate
     ```

3. **Install Dependencies**  
   Install the required packages using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
