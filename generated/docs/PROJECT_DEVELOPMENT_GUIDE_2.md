## Setting Up the Development Environment
To set up your development environment, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourproject.git
   cd yourproject
   ```
2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Code Style Guidelines
- Follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) for Python code style.
- Use meaningful variable and function names.
- Write docstrings for all public modules, functions, classes, and methods.

## Testing
- Write unit tests for all new features.
- Use `pytest` for running tests. To run tests, execute:
  ```bash
  pytest tests/unit/
  ```

## Deployment
- Ensure all tests are passing before deploying.
- Use the deployment scripts located in the `deploy/` directory.

## Contributing
- Fork the repository and create a feature branch.
- Submit a pull request with a clear description of your changes.

For any questions, please refer to the [README.md](README.md) or contact the project maintainers.
