# Test for Commit

## Project Overview
This project is designed to facilitate commit date manipulation for version control systems, particularly Git. It provides utilities for modifying commit dates and offers a set of tools to handle various date operations and formatting.

## Purpose
The primary goal of this project is to allow developers to modify the commit date of their changes, which can be useful in scenarios such as reordering commits or correcting commit timestamps in Git repositories.

## Installation
To set up this project, ensure that you have Python 3 installed. You can clone this repository and install the necessary dependencies with the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/test-for-commit.git
cd test-for-commit
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> **Note:** Ensure that you have a virtual environment activated to avoid conflicts with other projects.

## Usage
To run the main script, use the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```
This will display a simple greeting message. 

For more complex usage, you can utilize the functions defined in the `src/utils` module to perform various date operations. Refer to the documentation for detailed examples.
